        <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F9004718.jpg&q=60&c=sc&orient=true&poi=auto&h=512" alt="Seafood Boil">
        <p>Description</p>
        <P> Nothing says summertime better than a good old-fashioned seafood boil from Joy Wilson of Joy the Baker. This version removes the boil and takes it straight to the grill, creating personal foil packets loaded with shrimp, potatoes, sausage, and corn. It's simple and fun for backyard gatherings, and Reynolds Wrap Heavy Duty Foil makes cleanup a breeze! Serve with hot sauce and slices of crusty bread.

        <p>STEPS</p>
        <ol>
            <p>Step 1:</p>
            <li> Preheat an outdoor grill to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
            </li>
            <p>Step 2:</p>
            <li>
                Place potato quarters into a large pot of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes to jump-start the cooking process. Drain. 

            </li>
            <p>Step 3:</p>
            <li>
                Arrange four 12x18-inch sheets of foil on a clean work surface. 
             </li>
             <p>Step 4:</p>
             <li>
                Pile equal amounts shrimp, potatoes, kielbasa, and corn into the center of each sheet. Add 1 tablespoon butter to each pile, then drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and 1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce. Sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons Creole seasoning and 1/4 teaspoon pepper over each pile. Squeeze a lemon wedge over each pile, then place the rind on top. Wrap each piece of foil into a tightly sealed packet. 
                             </li>
            <p> Step 5:</p>
            <li>
                Place foil packets onto the preheated grill. Cover the grill; cook and steam until shrimp and potatoes are cooked through, 15 to 18 minutes. 
            </li>
            <p>Step 6:</p>
            <li>
                Remove from the grill and carefully unwrap foil to serve. 
            </li>
            </ol>
