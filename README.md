# Odin_Recipes_2023

First project of coding in 2023

Hello guy, before going straight to my cooking recipes, i want to let you know one thing that this is my first time to write openly about something that related to myself. So i hope you guy can enjoy this one and go easy on me :)

Back to the main topic, i think i will call this project: "Totally Blueness", because blue is my color and it reflects a little bit of my character.

So what do we have? In this project, i will focus on every meal that share similarities of blue color and maybe demonstrare sadness. 

That's the idea,  are you ready to cook with me? Let's go.
